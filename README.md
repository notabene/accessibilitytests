# accessibilitytests

Name says it all: this is where we're going to test basic or less basic things.

PLEASE NOTE: there is a gh-pages branch that pushes to a [Github page](http://notabene.github.io/accessibilitytests/) automatically

Nothing to see here anymore, [look at the `gh-pages` branch for up-to-date pages](https://github.com/notabene/accessibilitytests/tree/gh-pages.
