    <title>Alternate text for touch interfaces</title>

    <p>Considering alternate text is useful for other people than screen reader users, we need a way to make emojis
        easier to understand even if people can't see the <code>alt</code> attribute.
        This Javascript method:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Finds all images with an <code>alt</code> attribute</li>
        <li>Adds a click event on them if they are not already inside a clickable zone (<code>a</code> or <code>button</code> for this proof of concept)</li>
        <li>Shows a small info bubble with the image's alt text</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This provides for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>People with low vision who don't know how to zoom their touch display</li>
        <li>People who don't know the meaning of an emoji</li>
    </ul>
